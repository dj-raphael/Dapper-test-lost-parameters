# Test project for catch exception when dapper lost parameters

Usage:
Run program in Visual Studio debug mode  
and wait for 1 minute, if exception is not catching - add 100-1000 additional workers  
if not catching in 10 minutes - restart program

without attached debugger I add about 10000 workers and wait about 10 hours
